# Web-programming-project
My first web-programming project on 2nd grade of education (Autumn 2021).
I made it using vanilla JS, PHP (xampp server), CSS (lecturer required to write everything in one CSS file). Project was made on a 1366x768 resolution display.

Here is youtube video link of how it looks >> https://youtu.be/KbM5PxCwoCQ
